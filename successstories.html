<body><i>“In April 2018 I joined this Madrasah and what I can say about the Madrasah is that the environment I was around was built in motivation for success. The teachers in the Madrasah were always looking for ways to help the students succeed and that is the one thing I really enjoyed about being in this Madrasah. They always put the students ahead of everything and looked for every possible way to make them not only strive in their learning of Hifz, but also do the best in making them role models. I am grateful for the teachers who took their time with me and helped manage my time in completing Hifz. For those who read this may Allah ﷻ make it easy for you and keep you steadfast in your journey of memorizing the Quran.”</i></body>

- Hafiz Sabri Faiz, 18 years old
<p>
<body><i>I spent over a span of two years in AIQ. The teachers are friendly yet firm. They pay attention to every student and know their weaknesses and strengths. The whole day is planned so that students finish all their assigned lessons. I am blessed to be a part of a Madrasah where the teachers are our real guide both in this life and the hereafter. We feel free to discuss anything from sports to current affairs with our Maulana. They keep our manners and Akhlaaq under check. For our teachers believe in complete development as an exemplary Muslim. Their dedication and love for each student is evident when they are ready to help at any time and give us extra time. From the first Hafiz to the latest we are still connected to the Madrasah. I am blessed and thank Allah ﷻ for choosing me to be part of this institution."</i></body>
- Hafiz Abdur Rahim Khan, 13 years old
<p>
<body><i>“I have completed my Hifz in this Madrasah. Ever since I joined this Madrasah, my performance has improved tremendously. The environment is friendly; the teachers give lots of attention to all the students, which allow them to work to their full potential. This Madrasah also emphasizes on having good manners and following the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.”</i></body>
- Hafiz Zakir Muhammad, 14 years old

<p>
<body><i>"I have been learning with this Madrasah since 2015 and Alhamdulillah it has helped in a great way.The Madrasah has a great learning environment which made my Hifz very easy, and helped me learn many different stories and rulings from the daily books time when we learn either Fiqh or Seerah. This benefited me greatly because I knew what to do and how the prophet did it on different occasions. The Madrassah environment is great overall and I was also able to make a bunch of great friends here."</i></body>

- Hafiz Yusuf Syed, 13 years old
<p>
<body><i>"I have memorized most of my Quraan in this madrassah. Ever since I joined, My Quraan became better and I was able to perform to my full potential. The madrassah also taught me the character and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, which made me into a better practicing muslim, and for that I am grateful to the madrassah and Allah ﷻ.</i></body>

- Hafiz Luqman Hatia, 13 years old
<p>
<body><i>"Alhamdulillah with the grace of Allah ﷻ I have completed my Hifz with the most helpful and engaging teachers. I have not only memorized the Quran but have learned the proper Akhlaaq and respect I need to remember and perfect it. I am very grateful for the environment and community in this Madrasah and I strongly believe that it will continue. I pray for whowever is memorizing the Quran or memorized to always have a positive and an engaging relationship with there teacher and a healthy environment to perfect themselves and their Quran. “And we have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember, then is there any that will remember?” (Surah Al Qamar 54;17)</i></body>
